Installation
============

.. include:: ../README.rst
   :start-after: installation-start
   :end-before: installation-end

If you do not want to use pip, even though it is highly recommended,
and prefer installing Instaloader manually,
`Download the Source <https://github.com/Thammus/instaloader/releases>`__,
extract the Zip or Tarball and execute ``instaloader.py`` from there.
