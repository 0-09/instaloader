Installation
============

.. highlight:: none

Instaloader requires `Python <https://www.python.org/>`__, at least
version 3.5.  If you have `pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`__
installed, you may install Instaloader using

::

    pip3 install instaloader

Alternatively, to get the most current version of Instaloader from our
`Git repository <https://github.com/Thammus/instaloader>`__:

::

    pip3 install git+https://github.com/Thammus/instaloader

(pass ``--upgrade`` to upgrade if Instaloader is already installed)

Instaloader requires
`requests <http://python-requests.org/>`__, which
will be installed automatically, if it is not already installed.

If you do not want to use pip, even though it is highly recommended,
and prefer installing Instaloader manually,
`Download the Source <https://github.com/Thammus/instaloader/releases>`__,
extract the Zip or Tarball and execute ``instaloader.py`` from there.
